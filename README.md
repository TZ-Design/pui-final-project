cmu 2021 pui final project

# Description
The purpose of this website is to provide an interactive data visualization for the dataset from Opportunity Insights that details the innovation rate by states and its specific gender distribution. I want the users to engage with the map to discover the state by state differences in innovation rate and reveal the entire choropleth through user interaction. I wish to present an untraditional way of telling data and let users discover data, which shows the unequal distribution of innovation rate by state and by gender. It’s interesting and fun because the website doesn’t give you the entire picture by default. Instead, users need to hover on each state to reveal the color and reference back to the legend to compare its rate in relation to other states. Upon hovering over each state, they will also see the bar chart and the detailed statistics on gender distribution of inventors from that state. The main target audience of the website is researchers or students who are interested in the topic of social economic research, and frequent news website readers.
