    <p>The visualization shows patenting outcomes for children born in 1980-1984 by state in which they grew up and their gender. 
        A child is defined as an inventor if he or she is listed on a patent application between 2001 and 2012 or grant between 1996 and 2014.
        Each child is assigned a state based on ZIP code from which his or her parents filed their 1040 tax return in the year the child was first claimed as a dependent. 
        (Innovation rates are calcualted by number of inventors / number of children born).
